    "GLHMM is a Python toolbox designed for neuroscience applications, specifically focusing on Hidden Markov Models ([HMM](../../docs/glossary.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "GLHMM supports multiple data modalities, including fMRI, EEG, MEG and ECoG, and offers a comprehensive set of HMMs tailored for different data types and analysis goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Gaussian** distribution is used in fMRI and other neuroimaging modalities.\n",
    "- The **Wishart** distribution is employed in fMRI to specifically focus on changes in connectivity (covariance).\n",
    "- The **Time-delay embedded** distribution is applied to whole-brain electrophysiological data (MEG or EEG), which, based on the Gaussian distribution, can also capture spectral modulations in the data.\n",
    "- The **Autoregressive** models provide a more detailed spectral description for electrophysiological data with a limited number of channels.\n",
    "- The **Regression-based decoding** models, such as the temporal unconstrained decoding model, describe the dynamic relationship between brain activity and ongoing stimuli.\n",
    "- The **Encoding** models emphasize the spatial interpretation of brain activity in relation to stimuli."
